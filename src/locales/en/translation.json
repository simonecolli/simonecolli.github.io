      "description": "Hi, I'm Simone! I'm a Computer Science Master's student, passionate about software development and photography. My journey, both personal and academic, began as a child with artistic roller skating—a sport that taught me the values of resilience, discipline, and patience. Over the years, I learned the organizational skills needed to balance life as an athlete and a student. Today, those same lessons allow me to manage the rigor of my academic path and the attention to detail I apply to my projects.",

    "bio2": "Throughout my academic and professional career, I have explored complex and diverse fields: from bioinformatics and parallel computing to artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. My experience spans from web development to operating system management and server environment configuration—areas that have given me a broad understanding of software infrastructure. I believe in the value of technical knowledge sharing, which is why I actively participate in open-source projects and community collaborations.",
    "bio3": "The passion I dedicated to sport for many years led me back to where I grew up, but with a new perspective. My goal today is to immortalize athletic gestures and the emotion of competition through sports photography. Along the way, I also love capturing the most significant moments in people's lives, such as graduations and events, as well as the small details of nature.",
